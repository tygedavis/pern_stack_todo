### Practicing the PERN Stack

This app is to help practice with the PERN (Postgres, Express, React, and Node) Stack, specifically to get more familiar with Postgres.

You can learn to make it too at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8). It is a great resource for learning the PERN Stack.
